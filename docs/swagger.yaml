  - name: "Tasks"
    description: >
      Tasks are tools and algorithms that a data-scientist writes in Jupyter Notebooks or in a Docker image.
      You may use these tasks as a step of an experiment to perform model training or inference.
  - name: "Projects"
    description: >
      Projects are a way to organize the problems a data-scientist is trying to solve.
      In a project, you may test different experiments (hypothesis/solutions/models) that address the business question you are trying to answer.
  - name: "Experiments"
    description: >
      Experiments allow data-scientists to draw acyclic workflows using tasks.
      These workflows may describe the steps of data-preparation, data-modeling.
  - name: "Experiment Operators"
    description: >
      An Operator is a single unit in an experiment flow.
      When a data-scientist runs an experiment, the operator runs a Jupyter Notebook of its task.
  - name: "Experiment Runs"
    description: >
      Runs are the executions of an experiment.
      Each run start from the first step and generates its own results.
  - name: "Deployments"
    description: >
      Deployments allow drawing sequential workflows for real-time inference.
      These workflows are accessible by HTTP via REST endpoints.
  - name: "Deployment Operators"
    description: >
      An Operator is a single unit in a deployment flow.
      When someone tests a deployment, the operator is a service that runs the Model.py of its task.
  - name: "Deployment Runs"
    description: >
      Runs are the executions of a deployment.
      Each run start from the first step and generates its own results.
  - name: "Predictions"
    description: >
      Predictions send a request with file data to seldon deployment.
  - name: "Results"
    description: >
      Results are the outputs of experiment runs.
      They are: figures, metrics, datasets and log messages.
  - name: "Logs"
    description: >
      Output logs of runs.
  - name: "Comparisons"
    description: >
      Comparisons organize results from different experiments for evaluation/comparision.
  - name: "Templates"
    description: >
      Templates are reusable workflows that a data-scientist may use to draw an experiment quickly.
  - name: "Monitorings"
    description: >
      Monitorings allow to ensure that models are maintaining a predetermined desired level of performance.
